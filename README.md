## Fish + AI Business - Fish-Nose

Fish have super good noses that can smell all kinds of things! Well, we made a computer fish nose that can smell fish too! This fish nose machine can smell what kind of fish it is, like if it's a Hoki fish or a Mackerel fish. It can even smell which part of the fish it's sniffing, like the head or the tail. Sometimes the fish get mixed together by accident and the fish nose sniffs that out too!

If stinky oil from a boat leaks onto the fish, the fish nose machine can smell that - yuck! It's good at finding fish that got oily and shouldn't be eaten. The best part is the fish nose knows each fish apart by their smell, like Sally the Hoki and Sammy the Mackerel! Our fish nose makes sure all the fish stay safe to eat. Pretty cool huh?

## Personal introduction

My goal is to leave the world a better place than I found it. I plan to bring that goal into reality by creating technology that improves the quality of life. These goals have motivated BE Honours (First Class) in Sofware Engineering. This objective has led me to a contract in Software Development at NIWA, collaborating with scientists and physicists to publish their research on our oceans and atmosphere to a global audience.  I am currently undertaking a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Software is a medium to explore my scientific curiosity and contribute a meaningful change.
